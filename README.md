# Type Tracker (Typing Speed Tester)

This project is a desktop application developed in **C++ with the Qt framework** that functions as a typing speed tester (similar to TypeRacer or 10fastfingers).

This project is an excellent example of a complete application, featuring a graphical interface and business logic.

## Features

*   **Graphical User Interface (GUI):** Developed using Qt Designer, providing an intuitive user experience.
*   **Words Per Minute (WPM) Count:** Calculates typing speed in real-time.
*   **Accuracy:** Monitors and displays the percentage of correct and incorrect entries.
*   **Time Control:** Management of the test duration.
*   **Game Logic:** Implementation of the logic to compare the user's input with the reference text.

## Demonstrated Concepts

*   **Desktop Application Development:** Use of the **Qt** framework to create a cross-platform application.
*   **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP):** Class structure for the main window (`TypeTracker`), game logic, and interface management.
*   **Event Handling:** Handling of keyboard events to capture user input.
*   **Interface Management:** Use of Qt _widgets_ and _layouts_ to build the GUI.
*   **Modern C++:** Utilization of C++ features and libraries.

## Project Structure

The project follows the standard structure of a Qt project:

*   `TypeTracker.pro`: Qt project file.
*   `typetracker.ui`: XML file describing the graphical interface (generated by Qt Designer).
*   `typetracker.h` / `typetracker.cpp`: Implementation of the application's main class.
*   `main.cpp`: Application entry point.

## How to Compile and Run

This project requires the **Qt Framework** and **Qt Creator** to be easily compiled and run.

1.  Open the `TypeTracker.pro` file in Qt Creator.
2.  Configure the build kit (Debug/Release).
3.  Execute the build.
4.  Run the application.

**Language:** C++ (Qt Framework) **Topics:** Desktop Development, GUI (Qt), OOP, Event Handling.
